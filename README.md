"# Sentiment_Analysis_Web_Dashboard" 


This code uses Dash to deploy phrase and sentiment analysis for Planetary_Care non-profit company. This is volunteer work I did for their research team. 

The code takes a pharase and returns subreddits that used those phrases and sentiments around those phrases. 

To upload to AWS elastic bean upload planetaryCare_ver3. It contains logo in assets folder, updated application.py and requirements.txt
